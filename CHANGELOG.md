# Changelog

### 0.24.0 — remove built-in subagent tools, adopt pi 0.78.x ctx.mode/streamingBehavior
- **Breaking**: Remove `ce_subagent` and `ce_parallel_subagent` tools and all subagent infrastructure (runner, events, renderer, depth guard, 6 tool modules, 5 test files). Net -3,660 lines.
- **Breaking**: Remove `08-help` skill (README covers the same information). Pipeline skills reduced from 8 to 7.
- **Pi 0.78.x adaptation**: `ctx.mode` replaces `ctx.hasUI` for notification guards; `streamingBehavior === "steer"` skips model/thinking switching during mid-stream interrupts.
- **Documentation**: `03-work` returns to inline-first; all `pi-subagents` references removed from README/README_CN (极简主义).
- **Exports removed**: `createSubagentTool`, `createParallelSubagentTool`, `createJsonRunner`, `checkSubagentDepth`, `getChildDepthEnv`, `DEFAULT_MAX_SUBAGENT_DEPTH`, `AsyncMutex`, `renderSubagentCall`, `renderSubagentResult`, `formatToolCall`, event parser types.

### 0.23.13 — fix parallel subagent inheritSkills default mismatch with ce_subagent
- **Bug fix**: `ce_parallel_subagent` now defaults `inheritSkills` to `true` (matching `ce_subagent` behavior). Previously, omitting `inheritSkills` caused `--no-skills` to be passed to child processes, silently disabling skill inheritance in all parallel subagent tasks.
- Updated tool schema description, interface JSDoc, and test expectations.

### 0.23.12 — adopt context glossary/ADR/debug discipline + tsc fixes + parallel progress
- **Skills (mattpocock/skills)**: `01-brainstorm` optional CONTEXT.md vocabulary, `02-plan` lightweight ADR template, `03-work` feedback-loop-first debug discipline. Zero new skills/tools.
- **Type fixes**: resolve 5 `bunx tsc --noEmit` errors (mode union, onUpdate bridge, pi.cwd, SingleResult import, unknown assertions).
- **Parallel TUI**: progress bar now shows total count (`1/3✓` instead of `1✓`).

### 0.23.11 — compact parallel subagent TUI with progress bar and summary cards
- **Call phase**: show all agents with numbered list instead of folding at 3.
- **Running phase**: live progress bar (█░) with done/running count.
- **Completed collapsed**: one-line summary per agent (icon + name + conclusion).
- **Completed expanded (Ctrl+O)**: full Markdown output per agent.
- **Content text**: compact summary instead of full output dump, reducing LLM context waste.
- 6 new renderer tests. 285 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.10 — subagent TUI live status via spawn-based JSON runner
- **New architecture**: `ce_subagent` and `ce_parallel_subagent` now spawn `pi --mode json` child processes with per-process env, replacing `pi.exec()` + global `process.env` mutation.
- **Real-time TUI updates**: tool calls, status icons (⏳/✓/✗), usage stats, and Markdown output rendered live during subagent execution.
- **Collapsed/expanded views**: collapsed shows agent + status + recent tool calls; Ctrl+O expands to full output + usage.
- **Parallel vertical layout**: each `ce_parallel_subagent` task displayed in its own box with per-task status.
- **Concurrency control**: `mapWithConcurrencyLimit` (from pi official example) limits parallel spawns to 4.
- **Shared event model**: `subagent-events.ts` provides `parseJsonEvent`, `applyEventToResult`, `invokeRunner`, `isSingleResult` used by both tools.
- **Per-process env**: no more `AsyncMutex` or `process.env` mutation; env passed via `spawn({ env })` options.
- **Renderer**: `subagent-renderer.ts` with `formatToolCall` (adapted from pi official example) for bash/read/write/edit/ls/find/grep.
- 284 tests passing, 72 new, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.9 — context hygiene rules
- Added shared Phase 1 context hygiene guidance for compacting resolved errors, fetching obvious prerequisites, capping repeated failures, and pruning handoffs before save.
- Added `03-work` recovery guidance to replace resolved stop-the-line traces with `ERROR(resolved): <root cause>` and stop after 3 repeated failures on the same tool, command, or unit.
- Added `humanlayer/12-factor-agents` to Design Philosophy & Acknowledgements as the inspiration source for context hygiene.
- Bumped package version to `0.23.9` for npm publishing and local upgrade detection.
- 212 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.8 — constrain CE subagent pipeline-stage delegation
- `ce_subagent` now rejects pipeline-stage skills (`01-brainstorm` through `05-learn`) and tells users to run those stages directly with `/skill:<stage>`.
- `ce_parallel_subagent` applies the same guard before spawning parallel tasks.
- `03-work` is now documented as inline-first, with CE subagents scoped to bounded, non-interactive, easily verifiable leaf tasks.
- README and README_CN clarify that Super Pi is a Pi-native engineering workflow layer, not a general-purpose multi-agent executor.
- 212 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.7 — ask_user_question: default allowCustom to true
- `ask_user_question` now defaults `allowCustom` to `true` when `options` are provided, automatically appending an "Other" option that lets users enter custom text.
- Existing callers can opt out by explicitly setting `allowCustom: false`.
- Updated tests to cover the new default behavior and the explicit opt-out path.

### 0.23.5 — Agent-skills micro-patterns: embedded behavioral gates, skill routing, repo hygiene
- **Skill descriptions** — all 8 skills now include "Use when" trigger conditions for accurate automatic skill routing.
- **Source-driven gate** — embedded in 3 locations: `rules/common/development-workflow.md` (rule) + `02-plan` workflow step + `03-work` workflow step. When implementation depends on a framework/library API or version-specific behavior, verify against official docs before implementing.
- **Stop-the-line rule (Hard gate)** — embedded in `03-work` Hard gates section. On unexpected failure: STOP → PRESERVE evidence → DIAGNOSE root cause → FIX → GUARD with regression test → RESUME.
- **Anti-rationalization** — when a gate fails or evidence is missing: do not rationalize, downgrade, or explain away the failure. Stop and report with evidence.
- **Review five-axis baseline** — added to `04-review` reviewer-selection: all reviewers evaluate across correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance.
- **Typo fix** — `performan04-reviewer` → `performance-reviewer`.
- **Repo hygiene** — `docs/` no longer tracked; `bun.lock` untracked.
- Approach B: all changes are edits to existing files, no new skills/tools/commands. ~410 tokens added.
- 209 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.4 — Memory Optimization Phase 2: activeRules, context-first skills, handoff lifecycle
- Added `activeRules?: string[]` field to `context_handoff` for preserving 1-5 continuation-critical rules across sessions.
- `activeRules` persisted in state, returned by load/latest/status, rendered in default handoff template.
- Backward compatible: old state files without `activeRules` normalize to `[]`.
- Soft constraint: >5 rules allowed without failure.
- Updated `pipeline-config.md` with "Start of skill: context loading" guidance (handoff-first before broad reads) and "End of skill: save handoff" lifecycle.
- Updated `02-plan`, `03-work`, `04-review` SKILL.md to load handoff as workflow step 1.
- Rewrote `06-next` recommendation logic with context-first priority chain: health → blocker → recommendNewSession → nextStage → mismatch → artifact-count fallback.
- 6 new tests for activeRules (round-trip, template, default, soft constraint, backward compat, custom markdown).
- 209 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.3 — Context handoff deterministic validation probes (Route B-lite)
- Added `context_handoff` `operation: "validate"` for deterministic continuation-readiness validation.
- 4 probes: `recall`, `continuation`, `artifact`, `decision`.
- `ok` requires `recall` + `continuation` only; `artifact` / `decision` gaps are warnings.
- Explanatory `checks` array for each probe with name, passed, reason.
- Placeholder filtering: `N/A`, `- N/A`, `Not run` do not count as evidence in markdown or structured state.
- All public output paths normalized to repo-relative.
- Tightened continuation: `verification` / `blocker` alone cannot pass continuation.
- 203 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.2 — Context handoff structured runtime-memory anchor
- Added 5 new optional structured fields to `context_handoff`: `currentTruth`, `invalidatedAssumptions`, `openDecisions`, `recentlyAccessedFiles`, `compressionRisk`.
- Persisted new fields in `.context/compound-engineering/context-state.json` for machine-readable runtime state.
- Extended default handoff-lite markdown template with matching sections.
- Added `workflow_state.context` that reads structured state from `context-state.json` with safe defaults.
- Added state normalization layer (`normalizeStateEntry`, `toStringArray`) for backward compatibility with legacy state files.
- Fixed `workflow_state` to filter non-string array entries from context state.
- Updated `pipeline-config.md` handoff-lite template with 5 new sections.
- 191 tests passing, 0 regressions.

### 0.23.1 — SKILL.md size minimization + thinkingStrategy support
- Minimized 8 SKILL.md files from 28KB to 18KB (-35% reduction) by moving detailed rules, templates, and examples to `references/` for on-demand loading.
- Created new reference files:
  - `ce-brainstorm-mode.md` (01-brainstorm): standard CE mode workflow
  - `solution-search.md` (02-plan, 04-review): grep-first strategy for solutions
  - `completion-report.md` (03-work): completion report template
- Expanded existing references:
  - `workflow-sequence.md` (08-help): detailed CE pipeline guide
  - `recommendation-logic.md` (06-next): merged skill-registry
- Added `thinkingStrategy` support for per-skill thinking level control.
- Extended settings loading to support global `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` as fallback when project-level `.pi/settings.json` lacks `modelStrategy`/`thinkingStrategy`.
- Simplified README.md and README_CN.md to essential content.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude all `docs/` content except `token-cost-evaluation.md`.

### 0.23.0 — CE extension tool namespace isolation for third-party compatibility
- Renamed `ce-core` subagent tools from `subagent`/`parallel_subagent` to `ce_subagent`/`ce_parallel_subagent` to avoid runtime tool-name conflicts with third-party extensions like `pi-subagents`.
- Updated `03-work` skill documentation and `README.md`/`README_CN.md` to reference the new `ce_`-prefixed tool names.
- Added TDD tests confirming tool names and runtime registration guard (no bare `subagent`/`parallel_subagent`).
- Added README compatibility section documenting coexistence of `ce_subagent`/`ce_parallel_subagent` with generic `pi-subagents`.
- Added `05-learn` solution artifact documenting the three approaches to extension tool overlap: delegation, source integration, and namespace isolation.
- Fixed user-facing error message in `ce_parallel_subagent` to use the correct tool name.

### Unreleased — Workflow simplification and rule loading cleanup
- Merged `08-status` into `06-next`; `06-next` now supports both next-step recommendations and verbose full status reports.
- Removed standalone `10-rules`; `02-plan`, `03-work`, and `04-review` now load project rules directly and share `skills/references/language-detection.md`.
- Renamed `09-help` to `08-help` so skill numbering remains continuous after removing `08-status`.
- Added `rules/common/naming.md` for simple, everyday, low-ambiguity naming conventions.
- Registered `context_handoff` as an official ce-core tool and export.
- Clarified `07-worktree` as an optional isolation utility that requires user confirmation before create/merge/cleanup actions.
- Clarified `subagent` as a low-level utility for valuable dependent serial chains; small work should stay inline and independent work should use `parallel_subagent`.
- Split changelog history from README into `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG_CN.md`.

### 0.19.5 — Plan/Work/Review skill rules loading alignment
- Fixed `02-plan` not loading language-specific rules (e.g. `rules/typescript/`) during the planning phase — only `common/` rules were loaded.
- Fixed `03-work` Core rules missing explicit `common/` loading and `web/` conditional loading (10-rules defined them but the skill's own instructions didn't).
- Fixed `04-review` Core rules missing explicit language detection method and `web/` conditional loading.
- Updated all three skills to use a consistent 4-step progressive loading strategy (common → language detect → language rules → web rules).
- Updated `10-rules` SKILL.md Pre-flight to include complete language detection mapping for all three phases.
- Synced `README.md` and `README_CN.md` skill tables to reflect the unified loading strategy.

### 0.19.4 — Read output filter markdown truncation fix
- Fixed `read-output-filter` over-truncating markdown files: raised markdown threshold from 2KB → 8KB.
- Improved `filterMarkdown()` to fully preserve list items (`-`, `*`, numbered) and keep first 3 lines of paragraphs (was 1).
- Filter notice now includes actual file path in actionable guidance (`bash cat <path>`).
- Added 5 new tests covering list preservation, markdown threshold gate, and path-in-notice.
- 175 tests passing.

### 0.19.3 — Terminate fix + runtime model routing + autoContinue removal
- Fixed 6 ce-core tools (`brainstorm_dialog`, `workflow_state`, `review_router`, `session_checkpoint`, `session_history`, `pattern_extractor`) incorrectly returning `terminate: true`, which caused agent turns to end prematurely (brainstorm questions not shown, "type continue to proceed" interruptions).
- Implemented runtime stage model routing via ce-core extension `input` hook: reads `.pi/settings.json` `modelStrategy`, auto-switches model before skill execution. Supports full reference (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-1`) and bare model id (`claude-opus-4-1`).
- Removed `pipeline.autoContinue` configuration (never had runtime implementation; Pi lacks `skill_end` event for auto-continue).
- Updated `skills/references/pipeline-config.md`, `README.md`, `README_CN.md` to reflect runtime model routing behavior.
- Added 4 new tests covering terminate regression, input hook model routing, and bare model id parsing.

### 0.19.2 — Evidence-first handoff-lite + docs tracking rule
- Added `context_handoff` with evidence-first default handoff-lite generation when markdown is omitted.
- Standardized the shared handoff-lite template across 01-05 workflow handoffs via `skills/references/pipeline-config.md`.
- Added tests protecting default handoff generation and the shared handoff docs contract.
- Updated docs tracking so Git only uploads `docs/token-cost-evaluation.md` while other `docs/` artifacts stay local.

### 0.19.1 — Pipeline config + typecheck baseline fix
- Added shared pipeline config (`skills/references/pipeline-config.md`) for stage model routing via `.pi/settings.json`.
- Added runtime stage model routing via ce-core extension `input` hook (reads `modelStrategy` from `.pi/settings.json`, auto-switches model before skill execution).
- Fixed TypeScript baseline issues so `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes.

### 0.19.0 — 0.69.0 alignment + learn rename
- TypeBox migration: `@sinclair/typebox` → `typebox` (zero old-path imports)
- Peer/dev dependency upgrade: pi-coding-agent `0.67.6` → `0.69.0`
- Tool termination: 6 pure-query tools now return `terminate: true` to reduce unnecessary LLM rounds
- Skill rename: `05-compound` → `05-learn` for clarity
