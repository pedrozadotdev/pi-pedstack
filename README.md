[English](README.md) 

**Turn your AI coding agent into a reliable engineer.**

ped-stack is a Pi-native engineering workflow layer: it adds stage discipline, durable artifacts, TDD gates, checkpoints, review, and learning loops on top of your coding agent.

Install, describe what you want to build, then keep saying "continue." ped-stack drives the full loop:

 **think → plan → build → review → compound learnings.**

```bash
pi install npm:ped-stack
```

---

## Highlights

- **REST-like pipeline loop** — brainstorm → plan → work → review → debug → learn → docsync, with automatic skill routing
- **Checkpoint resume** — interrupted? Resume from the exact unit you left off
- **TDD enforcement** — every unit follows RED → GREEN → REFACTOR with hard gates
- **Evidence-first review** — auto-assigned reviewers across five axes, autofix loop
- **Knowledge compounding** — solved problems become searchable solution artifacts
- **Token-efficient** — ~4,200 tokens new-conversation overhead; progressive loading

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pi install npm:ped-stack
```

Then in Pi:

```
You: I want to build a CLI tool that helps indie devs find early users

→ 01-brainstorm: structured discovery → requirements artifact
→ 02-plan: TDD-gated implementation units → plan artifact
→ 03-work: inline execution, checkpoint resume
→ 04-review: five-axis findings, autofix loop
→ 04.5-debug: routing based on user testing
→ 05-learn: knowledge compounding
→ 06-docsync: synchronize documentation

You: continue
→ Next skill recommended via /skill:00-next
```

**Resume after interruption:**

```
You: /skill:03-work docs/plans/plan.md
→ Loads checkpoint, skips completed units, resumes from breakpoint
```

---

## The REST-like Pipeline Loop

```
01-brainstorm → 02-plan → 03-work → 04-review → 04.5-debug → 05-learn → 06-docsync
    think         plan      build      review       debug       learn      docsync
```

| Skill | What it does | Core tool |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **01-brainstorm** | Structured multi-round discovery, domain vocabulary persistence | `brainstorm_dialog` |
| **02-plan** | TDD-gated implementation units, optional CEO Review | `plan_diff` |
| **03-work** | Execution with checkpoint resume, strict TDD, subagent delegation | `session_checkpoint`, `task_splitter` |
| **04-review** | Auto-assigned reviewers, five-axis findings, autofix loop | `review_router`, `multi_reviewer` |
| **04.5-debug** | Routing based on user testing (return to work or continue to learn) | — |
| **05-learn** | Pattern extraction → searchable solution artifacts | `pattern_extractor` |
| **06-docsync** | Synchronize project documentation after completion | — |
| **00-next** | Next-step recommendation + workflow status | `workflow_state` |

### Model & Thinking Routing

Configure in `.pi/ped-stack/config.json`:

```json
{
  "brainstorm": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "thinkingLevel": "high"
  },
  "plan": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250115",
    "thinkingLevel": "high"
  },
  "work": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "thinkingLevel": "medium"
  }
}
```

Model and thinking level switch automatically — no manual `/model` needed.

## Design Philosophy & Acknowledgements

**80% planning and review, 20% execution.**

The goal is not to make AI write code faster. The goal is to make AI think before writing, review after writing, and compound what it learns.

Super Pi is not a fork or wrapper. It extracts useful methods from the projects below and rebuilds them with Pi-native skills, tools, artifacts, checkpoints, and handoffs.

| Project | What Super Pi adopted |
|---------|------------------------|
| [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) | "Use when" skill trigger conditions, source-driven verification, stop-the-line hard gate, anti-rationalization, and the five-axis review baseline. Adopted as embedded micro-patterns only — no new skills, tools, commands, or agents. |
| [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | Checkpoint resume, continuous learning loops, and token-conscious agent workflow design. |
| [humanlayer/12-factor-agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) | Context window ownership, compacting resolved errors, retry caps, and pre-fetching obvious prerequisites. Adopted as lightweight context hygiene rules inside the existing Phase 1 pipeline. |
| [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Strict TDD gates, design checklists, review discipline, and the idea that agents need hard gates instead of gentle suggestions. |
| [compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) | The five-step think → plan → build → review → learn loop and the knowledge-compounding backbone. |
| [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) | YC-style forcing questions, CEO Review cognitive frameworks, browser QA patterns, failure maps, and evidence-first validation. |
| [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) | Context glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) for cross-session term persistence, lightweight ADR with three-condition threshold, and feedback-loop-first debug discipline. Adopted as reference templates embedded into existing skills — no new skills or tools. |

## Behavioral Gates

### Stop-the-line (Hard gate)

When an unexpected failure occurs during `03-work`:

1. **STOP** adding features
2. **PRESERVE** evidence
3. **DIAGNOSE** root cause — build a feedback loop first, then reproduce → hypothesise → instrument → fix
4. **FIX** the root cause, not the symptom
5. **GUARD** with a regression test
6. **RESUME** only after verification passes

Anti-rationalization: do not rationalize, downgrade, or explain away failures. Stop and report with evidence.

### Source-driven verification

When implementation depends on a framework/library API, version-specific behavior, or a recommended pattern: verify against official documentation before implementing. Pure logic, renaming, or in-project pattern reuse does not require external citation.

### Review five axes

All reviewers evaluate changes across: **correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance.**

## Token Cost

New conversation overhead: **~4,130 tokens** (2.1% of 200K context).

| Component | Tokens |
|-----------|--------|
| 17 skill registrations | ~1,710 |
| 22 tool schemas | ~2,420 |
| Skill inlining (per invocation) | ~300–1,200 |

Progressive loading: only needed skills loaded on-demand.

See [docs/token-cost-evaluation.md](docs/token-cost-evaluation.md) for detailed per-skill breakdown and measurement methodology.
