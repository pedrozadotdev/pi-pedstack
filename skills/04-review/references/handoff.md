# Handoff from 04-review

When the review is complete:

1. Summarize the highest-priority structured findings.
2. State whether fixes or re-review are needed.
3. If findings are **autofixable**, apply the fixes and re-review the changes.
4. After autofix, report what was changed and whether re-review confirms the fix.
5. Recommend running `/ped-next` to route based on user verification (bug detection) via `04-5-debug`.
6. Mention any relevant plan or solution artifacts referenced during review.
7. Provide `🧠 Context Status` (health, handoff path, active files, new-session recommendation).
8. Save/mention handoff-lite path under `.context/compound-engineering/handoffs/` using the shared `Handoff-lite template` in `skills/references/pipeline-config.md`.

## Autofix loop

When findings have `autofixable: true`:

1. Apply the fix for each autofixable finding.
2. Re-run affected tests.
3. Re-review only the changed lines.
4. If re-review produces new findings, repeat (max 3 iterations).
5. Report final state: fixed, partially fixed, or needs manual intervention.
